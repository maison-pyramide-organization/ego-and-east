    Transferring their industry knowledge from London to the Middle East, the
    Lebanese sisters and business partners have used their combined 24 years of
    experience to create an innovative approach to talent management—an
    achievement that’s seen them featured on the pages of Vogue Business,
    Emirates Woman, Vogue Arabia, Grazia, and Cosmopolitan. Their distinctively
    mindful—yet tenacious—approach to business has gained them a roster of the
    region’s most exciting talent. Recently Ego & East embarked on a new and
    exciting adventure, merging in October 2022 with esteemed agency Maison
    Pyramide in what is set to be ‘one of the most forward-thinking mergers in
    the industry’.
